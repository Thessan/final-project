            Now it's starting to be a demanding little crab in there. The child grows - it is about 39 cm long and has lost over a kilo in weight and it grows so it cracks. About 27 grams a day it increases in weight, which may sound a bit but makes quite large demands on the mother's body. But it also becomes a more intense contact, with small kicks and puffs it reminds itself. It is known that the child has now developed the ability to remember. From the seventh month of pregnancy, the baby grows thanks to its ability to produce insulin. The function of insulin is to enable the body's cells to absorb the sugar that circulates in the blood after a meal. The cells use the sugar as energy, either burned or stored. This means that no fat needs to be broken down for energy and thus the insulin helps the baby to put on the hole during the last months of pregnancy.

            The baby grows and you feel it rock in your body - you become heavier and probably sweat more than you usually do. You can also become short of breath for the slightest bit, which is perfectly normal. It is not just iron deficiency (but ask the midwife for help to keep track of your iron value!) But is largely due to the fact that the baby is growing and there is less room for the stomach and lungs. At the same time, there is now an increased need for oxygen in several parts of the body; in the baby, in the uterus, kidneys and various muscles. Your heart fights and beats faster (to transport around the increased amount of blood) and therefore you breathe a little faster than usual. We know that it often starts to feel a bit of a struggle here, but despite that, it is important that you try to keep moving. On the one hand, it means that you get better blood circulation, which is good for the back, but it is also important to try to stay in as good shape as possible before the birth.

            Maybe parenting is starting to feel more real to you now as your stomach grows. It's clear that it's a little crab in there and you can probably feel how the baby moves when you hold your hand against your stomach. Ask the midwife for help in recognizing the baby's different body parts. It can feel good to know if it's a foot or a hand that makes itself known, or if you pat a head or a small butt.

            The child still has plenty of room to change position and hit somersaults inside the stomach despite his 40 cm and steady 1.2 kilos. But there is less and less space, now you can sense a foot or a hand from the outside of the stomach when the child takes the bar to turn. The head is still large in relation to the rest of the body which feels lean because it does not yet have that much subcutaneous fat. Different children move and kick differently, but most test their strengths and it is not uncommon for them to deliver a real kick from time to time so it can hurt for a while afterwards. The baby is now so big that the kicks can reach all the way to the ribs and to the bladder (which can result in a small surprise for the mother).

            If you are stressed or upset, the baby will probably react to the stress hormones that are released and circulate to the baby through the placenta. No one likes stress, try to calm the child by taking a few soothing breaths and relax. As the child grows and takes up more space, your internal organs are pushed aside. The uterus presses downwards, against the large blood vessels. You can then get more visible and more marked blood vessels and sometimes varicose veins appear on the legs. Support socks can usually feel comfortable and also facilitate the return of blood. You should also not sit too much with your legs crossed (it is also a hot tip if you have pelvic pain!). You can also get varicose veins at the rectum - better known as hemorrhoids. You recognize the unpleasant condition by the fact that it stings and itches in the buttocks. Hemorrhoids often disappear completely after the baby arrives, but it is difficult before that. Be sure to drink plenty of water as a sluggish stomach is the hemorrhoid's best friend. There is also ointment in pharmacies, but as always when it comes to medicines, you must check with the staff if it is okay to use during pregnancy.

            If you are expecting twins, it is not long until the birth now. About 50 percent of those who are expecting twins have given birth before week 37 is over, and the others will follow soon after because they usually start the birth for normal twin pregnancies then. As a prospective twin parent, you undeniably have a little more to think about. That there will not be much of the coveted free time after the birth is not something that is expected (hardly even if you are just expecting a child) but everything works if you just help. Imagine that you are a team, help each other and be understanding that you both need some breathing space at regular intervals. If there is also someone else you are close to who can be on hand and support you in everyday life, it is worth its weight in gold. All mothers who have given birth need to focus on resting their bodies and avoiding unnecessary stress. Becoming a parent and the emotional adjustment it can be can be quite dizzying. If you have then carried and given birth to two children, there may probably be an even greater need for rest, recovery and a little extra support.

            The baby continues to grow and more fat is formed under the skin. 41 centimeters and almost 1.4 kilos is about what the baby usually measures and weighs right now. The brain develops and grows, it must become large and in order for it to have space, it wrinkles itself more and more and forms its characteristic twists and flaps. Now the lungs are almost fully developed and the baby practices breathing movements by raising and lowering the chest. It is not uncommon for the exercises to cause the small child to hiccup, which is experienced as small twitches or for the stomach to squirt. A feeling that will appear often in the coming weeks.

            Now it is not very far left, and if you are expecting twins, you will probably soon be at the finish line. But even if you are now approaching the riot stretch, for most it is a few heavy weeks that await - both physically and mentally. The body can be experienced as a colossus and you can be ready to cry for the smallest little thing, which is not the least bit strange - thirty weeks with a demanding tenant takes its toll. Feeling tired and having more contractions is common. It can be a little better to take small breaks during the day as soon as you have the opportunity, and take the opportunity to rest your legs high. Those kind of little things can make you feel better. Try to listen to the body and above all be kind to it - there are still about 10 weeks left that the baby plans to use to grow big! Joint loosening, which results from the hormones softening joints and joints - especially in the pelvis, is common now. The loosening is to allow the birth canal to be slightly widened at birth so it will be easier for the baby to come out. Of course, this does not mean that it hurts less. Talk to the midwife and you will get help, for example with special belts for joint loosening or with tips on how you can learn to relieve the pelvis and joints in the best way in everyday life.

            Maybe you have started, or soon finished, some preparatory course for childbirth and parenthood. There are about two months left until it's time and the meeting with your little baby is fast approaching. Or, it may feel like it to you, but many pregnant women experience that it feels like there is an unbelievably long time left before the baby arrives. It's not so strange, most people are now getting more tired and it can be very hard mentally right now - being big, heavy and in pain takes its toll. After all, the baby is about 41 cm tall and weighs around 1.5 kilos! Listen to what your partner needs right now and see how you can help and support. That the child should be born NOW (!) Or that you should magically conjure away the joint loosening may be outside your job description, but there are certainly things you can do that make it easier for her. Sometimes it can also just be so heavenly nice to have someone who listens and tries to understand, no matter how abstract and difficult it may be for the one who does not carry the child.

            By monitoring children in the womb for long periods with the help of ultrasound, it has been possible to show that they dream while they sleep - that is at least how you interpret it, because the child's eyes move in the same way as sleeping adults' eyes when they are in the REM phase of sleep. What if you knew what they were dreaming… In most cases, the child has not yet turned his head down, but there are children who are out in good time to plan their trip. Then they make sure to lie down with their head (or small butt) down in the pelvic entrance, right at the beginning of the birth canal.

            If your pregnancy is normal and you are healthy, you will probably follow the so-called basic program at the maternity care center. Then it is usually time for another check-up with the midwife about now. You may feel that it is a little heavier to breathe, which is due to the uterus taking up more and more space. But the lungs pull their straw to the stack and have increased their capacity so that you have a sporting chance to oxygenate you and the baby in the womb properly. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon to feel that your regular walk takes an infinitely long time and consists of very panting. Another consequence of the larger uterus is that it constricts a little of the stomach space - this may well mean that you can fit with less food at a time, but must eat a little more frequently. Maybe you also feel that the contractions increase now that the stomach gets bigger? It is the body that slowly but surely prepares to give birth. You will probably feel that the load on your back and joints is getting bigger every week. It is now that you in good conscience should hand over heavy food bags to someone who does not carry a child in the womb. If there is no one else there, it is good to try to distribute the weight between both hands so you do not load at an angle.

            It is certainly quite challenging for your partner to find sensible sleeping positions nowadays. The growing stomach is in the way, you get dizzy (and should actually preferably avoid) lying on your back because the heavy uterus can press against the large blood vessel vena cava. No matter how medieval it sounds, a half-seated sleeping position is a good alternative, or that she lies on her side. Lifehacks that can help are to take an inflatable bathing ring to rest your stomach for a while, or to have large, firm pillows to put under one leg for a comfortable side position. If you want to surprise with a gift, ignore the fancy heels and instead aim for a so-called pregnancy pillow. It is designed to support the neck, abdomen and back and can be a lifesaver after endless sleepless nights. Extra good is that after the birth it can be perfect for a sore, newly delivered body - but also as a breastfeeding pillow.

            The time of the strong kicks may well be here now. The baby has unexpectedly a lot of power and can give real kicks to its tender mother. A well-aimed kick against the bladder can very well lead to you urinating a little - see it as a small reminder to do the squeezing exercises. The baby now weighs about 1.8 kilos. But even if the baby needs to get bigger, during the remaining eight weeks it should gain about two kilos more. How much it weighs once it comes out, however, varies and is governed by several things, including genetic factors and the week in which the baby is born. If the baby has a snout, it is now that the testicles begin their journey down to the scrotum. Should the scrotum look a little too big when the baby comes out, it is not something to worry about, the swelling comes from fluid that has accumulated and will go away after a week or so.

            It is completely impossible to know what one's birth will be like. But there is nothing to stop you from preparing for what you can actually keep track of. In a birth certificate, you can write down things that feel important to you, regardless of whether you are going to give birth vaginally or if it will be a caesarean section. And since you can never know for sure how urgent the little life is, it's good to write the letter pretty soon. A birth certificate must of course contain the name and social security number of the person who is to give birth. But after that, it's just for you to point out what you want the hospital staff to know about; if there is something you absolutely do not want, something you are afraid or worried about and how any other births have been. If the plan is to give birth vaginally - which it is for most people - it can be good to think about how you think about pain relief and delivery positions. However, all this is not something you need to decide in advance, but just write down how you think. The tip is to avoid the long novel format and instead aim for a bulleted list that the staff on site can look through in a short time if there is a bit of a hurry. Your partner, if you have one, or another companion should also know what it says. If you are unsure of how to start, there is a checklist in the Libero app. And as I said, nothing is written in stone. No one, absolutely no one, will find it strange if you change something in the letter. A birth can not be scheduled or planned in detail and you can have no idea how you will experience it. If there is something the staff on site are used to, it is changed plans.

            You may have noticed that your partner zooms out a bit sometimes? Many pregnant women experience - now that they are starting to approach the finish line - that it is difficult to keep their attention on things, difficult to make decisions and that you forget a lot. It may well be the sleepless nights that haunt, but that the thoughts wander may also be due to the fact that both body and bud focus on the child in the womb. The impending birth, the thoughts about what it will be like to be a parent - all this can make it difficult to focus on something else. Pregnant fog or brain porridge is often described by many as. That you sort of turn a little inward, lets the world stop at the same time as you check out most things yourself. Maybe you feel it yourself? Even if you do not have the baby in your womb, much of your focus is probably on the little parvel that is to come. Things you may have burned for before may feel a little trivial. This is not so strange but just one step in your preparation for becoming a parent. You can prepare in different ways. Some more concrete - like putting together a changing table, discussing child insurance or test driving prams (we have a good checklist in the Libero app for everything you have to talk about). But inside you may feel that thoughts are bubbling - how will it be? In what way will a new little life affect our family constellation, how much time does a child really take and the actual time you hear other parents talk about - will you have to give up your own interests? Talk about this and how you feel, with your partner and your friends. There are no mistakes or rights, but it is often good to be able to verbalize your thoughts and what you are thinking about is something that all expectant parents go through.

            Now let's talk weight! Two whole kilos have the little one - which just a few months ago was as small as a blackberry - come up in. And there will be more. 250 grams of subcutaneous fat per week should be put on, and in addition to that, the muscles will also develop. The lanugo hairs, the slightly coarse hairs that covered the body begin to disappear and the skin is smoothed out and is no longer as wrinkled as before. The ability to regulate body temperature has also matured, although it is a skill that must be honed once the baby is out! All organs, such as the lungs and respiratory center, are fully developed.

            Maybe your stomach has sunk, maybe it's too early for you yet. Many people feel that it is a bit of a relief when it happens, because then there is little room for the lungs to breathe. Some even claim that it feels like they got their waist back… But as I said, not everyone's stomach sinks, but it can just as easily happen just before or during childbirth. It is not uncommon to find it a little uncomfortable when the head touches the pelvic floor muscles - a stinging sensation, a bit like numbness. Try to lie on the side. This reduces the pressure on the pelvis, nerves and blood vessels, which can make it feel better. Finding clothes you feel comfortable in during this part of pregnancy is not always the easiest. You may feel big and puffy and have zero desire to look for maternity clothes that you can still only wear for a few weeks before they are too small or sit uncomfortably. A tip is to ignore the pregnancy department and instead think about what you want to wear. An oversized t-shirt, a pair of comfortable tights, unbuttoned shirts or a roomy dress can often work. Highlighting your belly instead of hiding it can also be fun, try what happens to a figure-hugging stretch dress or pencil skirt with a soft waist. If you are not a fan of tight-fitting clothes, it is still possible to mark the belly with a belt or an elastic band that goes just above it.

            Pregnant bellies can look very different, both in terms of size and shape. Unfortunately, many pregnant women have to put up with clumsy comments about their stomachs; that it is too big, too small, that you are expecting twins, should stop eating cakes and think about the figure. Comments about the stomach can both be incredibly hurtful and provoke negative thoughts about food, but also help to raise a lot of unnecessary anxiety. For example, being told that your stomach is "soooo small" can make you start to worry that the child is not growing and developing as it should. Very few people would think of commenting on someone else's body in that way if it was not a pregnancy in the game. But as soon as someone is expecting a child, it seems that the pregnant body is a general topic of conversation and it is perfectly okay to say what you think. Of course this is not the case and here you as a partner can stand up and mark if you hear someone comment on a pregnant woman's extent. And no! It is not possible to determine the sex of the baby depending on the shape of the stomach. It is nothing but a tenacious myth.

            Now the child's match weight is approximately 2.3 kg. It is a full 46 cm long and has feet that are around 6-7 cm long. But there is still room for about a liter of amniotic fluid in the peritoneum where the baby lies and listens to a rumbling stomach and a safe heartbeat. After the birth, the baby therefore wants to lie as close as possible, as it feels safe in the sound of the body. The suction reflex is also clear right now, some children suck on the thumb as you can see and you can assume that the suction reflex also provides security for the child when it comes out. Then the baby can show that it is hungry and wants to breastfeed by directing its hand towards its mouth for its own machine and sucking on it. The eyes have developed and the pupils can dilate and contract. There are researchers who believe that the child can already focus his gaze. Something we probably know is that there is a difference between light and darkness and thus can perceive day and night.

            Now the stomach has probably become so large that the navel can bulge out instead of in, like a small button. It will return after delivery when there is room again. You may also have seen a dark stripe from the upper abdomen and down? This dark line, Linea nigra, is often more clearly visible the darker skin you have but will fade after childbirth and in most cases disappear completely. It is also common to get stretch marks that mostly appear on the chest, abdomen and buttocks. How much you get is hereditary, and even if for most it does not disappear completely, they fade after childbirth. You can buy different oils and ointments to counteract the stretch marks, but there is no evidence that they work - instead try to see the stretch marks as proof of what your body has done! Then it can still be nice to lubricate and massage the stomach - both for you and the baby. If you belong to the twin club, you will probably give birth pretty soon. The fact that twins are usually born earlier is due to the uterine tube being loaded harder by two small children. On average, most twins usually want to come out two to three weeks earlier than a child who is alone in the womb, but it is not at all uncommon for them to come earlier anyway. During a vaginal birth, they can come directly after each other - as if they were in a queue - but usually the body is wise enough to take a short break so it takes a while between the first and second child.

            The only thing that can be said with certainty about births is that they can rarely be planned. Of course you have been given a date for the expected birth, but only 5% of the children think it is something to stick to. There is also no template for what to do to support during childbirth, once it comes, as all births are different. What you can know is that it will most likely not be as you imagined - much can change on the spot and it is impossible to know how you will feel there and then. However, there are a few things that you who stand next to - in the most important supporting role of your life - can help with. First of all, if there is a birth certificate, it is good if you know what it says. If you have also read about pain relief and delivery positions, you will more easily keep up with what the midwife means. You can then get the role of tour guide and tell what is happening and where in the process you are - if there is something that can calm down. As a partner, you often also become responsible for nitrous oxide. Then you should instruct when and how she should breathe - but do not worry, you are not expected to know it as running water in advance but the midwife will show on site. You can also help and bathe a sweaty forehead and remind to refill with liquid if it becomes prolonged. (Do not forget that you also need fluid and energy!). Remember that you are the one who knows your partner best and knows what you have talked about before the birth, be sure to bring her case if she does not have the strength. Most important of all is that you will be a hand to hold and the emotional support needed to give self-confidence. Do not be surprised if her wishes here and there change to what you talked about before or what is in the birth certificate, it depends entirely on how she experiences the situation. Think that what is said on the spot is what applies.

            The skin of the toddler is still covered by a thick layer of fetal fat, vernix, which protects it from the amniotic fluid - when the baby comes out, there is a good chance that much of the fetal fat is left on the body so it looks a bit greasy. The umbilical cord is almost half a meter long and a bit reminiscent of an old telephone cord: twisted, elastic and strong. The baby weighs about 2.4 kg and will increase by 25-30 grams a day in the future. Now that the last bit of pregnancy is approaching, most children usually go to bed prepared, with their head fixed down in the pelvis. This may be one of the reasons why it moves in a different way than before, the turning space becomes smaller. But even if the movements feel different, they are felt as often as before. Many people experience that the child has more specific sleeping and waking periods - with a hollow walk on the evening twig - a sleeping routine that the baby will probably take out of the stomach.

            Is not the stomach a little too small? Sure you are not expecting twins? How much have you really gone up? Now you CANNOT get bigger anyway! Or you may be surprised by someone taking the liberty to feel your stomach without asking. The environment's reactions to the pregnancy can make one both wild and sad - with good reason. Since when did it become okay to comment or touch someone else's body in that way? You are not public property just because you happen to be pregnant and the environment must accept that. Backing away demonstratively when a couple of unwelcome people is approaching your stomach, or happily answering "thank you" when someone comments on how huge you have become can be a good way to start a conversation about when it's actually okay to comment on other people's bodies. We know that you do not always have the strength to take that talk, especially if it is a close relative who behaves clumsily, but standing up for how you feel about this can make you avoid it in the future. Explaining if you are sad or worried about their comments is good - because in all probability the sender does not intend to make you feel bad and if you say no, they get a thought and can change their behavior.

            Now it is starting to get crowded for the baby and heavy for the mother. The baby pushes and presses from the inside, which is stressful to say the least. It is not a picnic to be heavily pregnant. The baby has been preparing for a long time before the birth and is slowly getting ready, it has probably settled down with its head down. A few babies choose other positions, across or with the buttocks down, so-called seat bidding. If this happens, you will be offered a turnaround attempt, as you should preferably give birth so that the baby's head comes first. An attempt to turn around means that an obstetrician tries to get the baby to change position by pressing on the stomach in a special way. It may look scary to the viewer, but doctors are fully aware of what they are doing. However, the mother may become a little sore in the abdominal muscles afterwards. Turning attempts are made at the earliest in v.36 and are, as you can understand if you see it, not something you should try to do yourself. It can be good to know that not all turning attempts are successful, but that the baby can take its own initiative and turn later. If it is a child who really does not want to, but stubbornly hangs in the seat offer, it may be relevant with a caesarean section. Many children, but not all, also fixate themselves towards the end of pregnancy. This means that the baby's head sinks deep into the pelvis. Once the child is fixed, it can not turn around again - but then it stays where it is. At the check-ups, the midwife will feel if the baby is fixed or jerky. One can think that when the head lands down in the pelvis, the birth should be around the corner, but there is no connection with when the baby fixates and when the birth starts. If you are a first-time mother, the child is usually a little faster at settling in than the children who follow in the sibling group, why you do not know. Then there are also some babies who have no interest in sliding down into the pelvis at all and they then talk about the baby being mobile.

            Now the child has become about 47.5 cm and weighs between 2.5 and 2.7 kg - a bit depending on the individual. The whole face has rounded and looks more and more like it will when you get to see it for real for the first time. A finished individual is getting ready to get out, only the final sprint - the last month - left. Even if it is already possible to give birth and the body functions as it should, the plan is for the baby to put on another kilogram before it happens!

            Being pregnant is often tough for both body and psyche - at least towards the end. You can be fed by messages about "enjoying the pregnancy bubble" or "catching the day" and although of course it may be possible for some, it is more often the case that you feel both stress and anxiety. Both when you are pregnant and when the baby has arrived. Hearing about that wonderful feeling, and not feeling it, can be incredibly difficult. Many people become worried that they feel "wrong", wonder where that strong feeling for the child in the womb is or perhaps doubt that you will become a good parent. All of these emotions are common, and are due to lots of different things. Maybe the pregnancy was not planned, or on the contrary it was super-planned, took a long time and many tears - clear that the stress of not feeling heavenly happy can be overwhelming. Or the pregnancy bubble is overshadowed by fear of childbirth, anxiety for the baby in the womb or perhaps bad memories from one's own childhood. There can be thousands and thousands of different reasons. It is very important to dare to talk about these feelings, because if you dare to bring it up, it will seep out that far from all pregnant women are so heavenly happy. For the vast majority, the feelings of the child are a process that needs to develop over time, a time that is different for different individuals. For some, the immediate love comes during pregnancy or right at birth, but for many, it actually takes longer than that. It may take weeks or maybe months before it feels heartfelt, but trust that love will never give up but continues to grow. And surely it is the case that you, without you even thinking about it, already now give small expressions of care for the child. A hand on your stomach when it kicks, small songs you sing or that you have actually changed large parts of your lifestyle for the sake of the child. Be kind to yourself, you will be a good mother.

            Maybe you are intensely longing for the baby to come now! To see and hold your little child for real. Thinking a lot about the baby that will soon be born means that you inevitably think a lot about the great responsibility that will come. It is a rather breathtaking feeling to know that you, for a very long time to come, will have the privilege of being one of the most important people in your child's life. It is quite common for you, with your own child on the way, to start thinking about your own parents, your childhood and upbringing. How you see your future parenting is of course affected by how your own childhood has been and is an important step in developing emotional ties to your child. Some things you can look back on with warmth and want to give your own child, while there are other parts you absolutely do not want to pass on. No matter what your experience of childhood was like, it is a good time to reflect on what is important to you. Then your parenting will be different from your parents' because you and your partner are two completely different individuals - but take the chance and talk about how you can best build a parenting that you believe in together, and what kind of support you need from each other.

            Finished! Or nah, the baby is usually so ready for life that it can do without neonatal care if it were born now. But most parents have to wait a few more weeks before it's time to see each other. The child still has some stuff on his to-do list inside the stomach: Increase the weight by 200-250 grams / week to have even a little more to take off when it comes into the world. Put the lungs in hard training by pulling in and pushing out amniotic fluid. Store important nutrients so it can cope with the strenuous birth. Test this with the coordination a little extra - being able to grasp things with your fingers is quite new. And - if it is not fixed yet - lay your head down towards the pelvis. Should it be the case that the child chooses the butt first, you will be offered an attempt to turn the child.

            Is the changing table prepped and the BB bag packed? It may be time to start arranging it now, we have a small checklist in the app. You still probably have some control left with the midwife before it's time. If there is something that worries you before the birth, take the opportunity to talk about it. Even if you have written a birth certificate, it is common for you to also note what you want, or if you are worried, in your journal. It follows from the maternity ward to the maternity ward so that the staff who will be there with you can take part in it. Now you may feel increasingly strong contractions in the uterus, they are not dangerous but see them as reminders that it is approaching the moment when you get to meet your little baby for the first time. Around now, it is common for most people to stop working and start parental leave - it can be nice to have some time to rest before the life-changing event that is coming. And to have some time to prepare. If you are more parents, make sure to divide the responsibility to prep everything before the baby's arrival, partly so that you can rest - but also so that a partner can keep track of the situation. Have you planned to breastfeed the baby? Be prepared that it may be a struggle. The baby has a strong sucking reflex and before all the milk has flowed and the technology is in place, it often hurts more than you could have imagined. But calm down! The evil disappears when the milk production has started, the nipples have gotten used to it and the baby and you have found the right one. Try to find peace in it (and that there may be a couple of feeds you get cold sweats through) because once it is in place, it will be cozy moments for both of you. Do not hesitate to seek help either; there are breastfeeding pacifiers, healing and good creams and cooling breastfeeding compresses to use. Also ask the staff at BB to help so that you can start breastfeeding - they can, for example, show you how to milk out a little yourself so the milk starts when the baby takes the first time.

            A push gift is, like so much else, an initially American phenomenon that has become quite common in Sweden. For those of you who have never heard of it before, it is simply a gift you give to your partner to draw attention to the achievement of carrying one - or more - children for nine months and then undergoing childbirth. But giving new mothers appreciation in the form of gifts is a phenomenon that exists in many cultures. Whether your partner would appreciate a push gift or not, you probably know best yourself. But if you want to give something after the birth, keep in mind that it is something that should be a memory and that it should be for her - not for the baby or your joint family. It is common to buy jewelry or a watch with engraving or a photo collection with pictures from the pregnancy. But it does not have to be something material, maybe it bangs even louder if it is in the form of a personal letter where you show your love and appreciation. If you doubt that it is something she would appreciate, there are guaranteed to be a bunch of friends you can consult!

            Most children now usually weigh more than three kilos. It is full and quite a few children are coming already now. If it is the first child, however, it is common for the child to stay in the womb for the time being and often even a little longer. It simply comes out when it decides it's time, there's not much else to do but wait for it to be ready. Most of the time, it has at least offered so much that it has sunk down a bit so it will be easier for the person carrying the child to eat and breathe. A birth is also stressful for the baby, so it has prepared well by, for example, storing extra nutrition. The subcutaneous fat also acts as a small energy reserve during the first time outside the stomach.

            Now you probably have some tough weeks of waiting and physical discomfort ahead of you. It can be tricky to find comfortable positions to sit and lie in, as the stomach is now both large and in the way. Sleep may also be a nuisance, you may sleep restlessly and wake up often - it is the body that is preparing for the baby's arrival and with it probably also odd sleeping times. Even if you are not usually able to fall asleep in the middle of the day, try to take the chance to rest as often as you can, lie down on the bed for a while and let go of all the musts. Right now, your only important must is to take care of yourself. The baby will not be upset about dust in the corners or if you forgot to wash your hair. If you belong to the lucky ones who have extra energy over like this in the end, it is better that you put it on to take a walk or do something else you know you feel good about! Maybe you're looking for the first real sign that childbirth is starting? There are a number of different signs that it is close, but really just a sign that it has really started: regular pains. When you have had pain for a few hours, and there are 3-5 minutes between them, it is time to call the delivery. Take the help of the timer for contractions in the app so you do not have to keep track of the numbers yourself, when you talk to the delivery they will always ask how often the pains come.

            Thus, in the times of waiting, it can feel as if time is just coming to an end. A tip - in addition to trying to stay healthy and fit so you do not risk infecting your partner and can be part of the birth - is to try to find something to do before the baby's arrival. If the BB bag is not packed, it is good to get it in order now, it may be the last thing you want to have to control when the pains have really started. Do you belong to the foresighted and already packed a bag that has been allowed to stand in a corner and collect dust for ten weeks? Look through it again to see what actually ended up in it. Maybe you have a little more feeling for size and know that that ugly body in size 48 will be too small for the baby. Taking your partner on some form of activity so that you both can be a little distracted and not feel that whole days are spent just waiting can also be a good idea. We are not talking mountain climbing or messy shopping center, but more to rush forward on a sparse visit to a museum or enjoy nature in slow motion - things with just the right activity and length that make her not feel chained at home with her eyes on the clock. Another tip is to prep food and freeze it, it is incredibly nice to not have to spend time and energy on cooking when you can spend it just watching your newborn baby. An activity that most parents can devote hours to if they have the opportunity. Yes, and of course it takes time to feed, change diapers, comfort, cuddle, carry, feed, change diapers and so on. Before you are there, it is often difficult to understand how much time such a small life can require. Did you plan to buy a new pram and missed the detail that they have a long delivery time? Do not despair, you are by no means alone and there are often very good used copies to get hold of. In addition, the tiny child can often appreciate being carried in a baby wrap near the body rather than lying alone in a pram for the first time. A good car seat, especially if you intend to take your home from BB by car, is important to prioritize. If the panic creeps in that you have not bought so much stuff for the baby, you can breathe a sigh of relief. The little ones often demand less than you might think! Also, do not forget to whitewash your network of contacts, many who have had children are usually just happy to lend or give away what their little rascal has grown out of.

            The baby is now ready anyway and has received nutrition and antibodies to cope with the first time outside the uterus via the placenta. Contrary to many people's beliefs, a newborn baby does not have a poor immune system but can develop immune responses to most types of infections. However, the small body has never encountered any infections before, which is needed for the immune system to develop. This is why babies start life with their mother's antibodies and then develop their immune system as they go through various infections. Then it is wise to postpone colds and other illnesses to the future like this when the baby is brand new. Let it get to know your parents for a while before you go out on the town or go to a café. Being allowed to be alone in the baby bubble and just land is therefore also good from an infection point of view. Then the loved ones who certainly want to welcome the little one to the world can come, as long as they are healthy and well. There is also no rule that says that everyone must be allowed to hold the baby when it is completely new. If it does not feel good for you as a parent, others may be content to look at, and marvel at, the little life from a little distance.

            If you have a caesarean section planned, you know both the date and time when you will see your baby, an incomprehensible feeling after months of carrying it inside you. But if you - like most others - are going to give birth vaginally, how do you know when it's time? If it is also your first child, there is nothing to compare with. This with the water flowing is something many people have as a stopping point for the birth to start. But the fact is that only 10-15% start that way, so it is more common with water loss during childbirth. In addition, you should not expect the big Hollywood splash, it can certainly be just like on film (except that the child rarely comes in a hurry right after the water). But it is more common for it to flow slowly or leak a small amount of liquid. However, you should always contact the delivery if you know, or suspect, that you have had a miscarriage, as they can tell you how to act. So sitting and waiting for the water to go is no idea, what you should instead keep an eye on are the pains. If they are regular - three to four aches within ten minutes - and about a minute long, it's time to call the delivery. If you are unsure, call once more - no one at the birth will think you are calling too often. If you are worried or do not know how to interpret the body's signals, it is better to hear from you once too much. Then it is of course super important that you get in touch if you notice that something feels different, perhaps reduced fetal movements or if bloody discharge appears.

            Now it does not take long before you have your little baby in your arms. A rather abstract feeling that is impossible to understand before you have experienced it yourself. Hope you have the opportunity to have a lot of time with both each other and the baby in the beginning, we know it sounds cliché but the first time with your little baby will not come again - the opportunity to marvel at the little life you have created is worth capturing. For many, this first time becomes extremely emotional, most people who have given birth to a child feel a little depressed in the beginning. Baby blues, as it can be called, is completely normal and is partly due to fatigue after childbirth, hormones that go bananas and of course the huge life change that a new little life to take care of means. But it's not just crying but usually the emotions are like a roller coaster, you can feel happiest in the world to cry big in the next second, feel apathetic and generally powerless - to then be back in the rush of happiness. Even if you have not carried the child, it is common for you as a partner to also feel depressed. Which is not so strange, you influence each other's moods. If it is the case that the depression does not want to go away, and you can see that your partner is feeling bad, it can be about postpartum depression and it is something you need help to get out of. At bvc (child care center) you are usually good at capturing how the new parents are feeling - including you - but it is also possible to contact the health center or bvc yourself if any of you need help.

            The baby weighs somewhere around 3.5 kilos but the size of the baby differs a lot so far into the pregnancy. There are those that are smaller and those that are larger when they come out. This is how in week 40 most babies are actually born, even though only about 5 percent come on their exact date. It is therefore completely normal that it takes a little longer than the date you have been waiting for, so you should not worry. The care will not count one as overweight until after two weeks after the estimated date of birth. If the baby is born vaginally, you can see that it has a slightly pointed head shape, which is not so strange considering that the little head has just been pushed through a narrow birth canal. But do not worry, within a few days the head will have regained its round shape again. Many newborn babies are also affected by pregnancy hormones. They can make the size of some body parts larger than otherwise, for example, the nipples may be swollen and the genitals look disproportionately large. It is completely normal and disappears fairly quickly.

            We know that you can experience that every day that passes is a day too much to wait for the child. But if it feels hopeless to pass your due date, it can be a comfort to know that 90 percent of everyone who has passed week 40 will give birth before week 42 is over. Although every morning without the slightest sign that the baby is happy to come out is stressful, it's just a struggle. You may have heard someone say that having children is like running a marathon. For those who are not runners, it may not be a further reference, but you may still be able to guess what a great strain it is for the body, and that it will most likely last for quite a few hours. So it's a pretty good idea to recharge a little before the birth. But how can you do that when all you want is for the baby to come? For example, it is about resting and eating very slow carbohydrates. Exercising deep breaths is also good because it improves oxygen supply and provides more energy. Since you can not know when the baby will start the race, it is good not to postpone the rest and think that it is tomorrow you start with it. Also remember that your body, no matter what it looks like, is actually made to give birth - it has taken 40 weeks to prepare brilliantly. It is clear that it really hurts to give birth, it is just as good to adjust - but unlike most other pains, labor pains do not signal that something is wrong in the body. It can be a good idea to stick to when it hurts the most. Try to face the first pain with full confidence that your body will tell you exactly how to do it. And you, also take pain relief if you feel you need to, there is no prestige in giving birth without it.

            Is it Wednesday today? Then the chance is a little greater that the baby will come. Because according to the statistics, most children are born on Wednesdays. Sundays, on the other hand, are the day when the least number of babies want to come out. If the baby is still in the womb, you continue to see the midwife at regular intervals and then do the usual checks such as measuring the uterus, listening to the baby's heart and checking how it is in the womb. Most births start on their own when the baby thinks it's time. There are those that may need to be started and then there are a few different methods to use; pain-stimulating tablets, vaginal gel, the balloon method or giving pain-stimulating drip. The method used is different and depends on the circumstances and how mature the uterine tube is. It may be nice to know that an initiated birth does not have to differ much from one that started by itself, and that the midwife begins to discuss and plan ahead for possible initiation when you have passed week 40. Even if the child still lives inside the womb and seems to want to stay right now, then the probability is greatest that the birth does not need any traction to get started.

            The baby has it cozy in there in the womb and the amniotic fluid that it is surrounded by continues to be produced until the baby is born. The skin of the baby is completely pink but not as wrinkled as before, the subcutaneous fat that has formed in recent weeks has filled in and rounded. The baby is soft and flexible so that it can easily swipe through the birth canal when it is time. The exception is the head, which, apart from the fontanelle - the soft part at the top of the head - is hard. The fountain should be soft and will come together during the course of the first year. It is not uncommon for you to think it feels a little scary with a soft part in the middle of your head, a part where you can also often see the small child's pulse pulsing. But the soft part has an important function in making the head, which is the largest body part, more malleable and then also easier to give birth to. Then it also needs to be malleable for the head and brain to be able to grow.

            We know, it's hard to just go and wait, but you do not go completely without a lot, there are actually benefits to being pregnant a little longer. This is because the uterine tube has time to mature and the hormone relaxin will soften your pelvic joints even a little more, so that the birth can take place a little smoother. Although raspberry leaf tea, acupuncture and pineapple are often mentioned as ways to speed up childbirth, there is no evidence that it would work. But it does not hurt either, so you feel that you want to test, it is free. However, you should absolutely avoid those tips that hard physical work or that enemas should start the birth - you do not need to listen to such advice! A safer way is membrane wrapping. If the midwife can see that the uterine tube is ready, you can sometimes do a membrane wrap to help start the pain. It is done through a vaginal examination and involves a midwife or doctor stimulating the uterine tube. When stimulated, a hormone is released that can help initiate labor. It's not very nice, but can sometimes be a little painful. If it hurts too much, you cancel. Sometimes you also get a minor bleeding after a membrane wrap.

            This passing of the birth date can actually be quite daunting for many, perhaps especially for the one carrying the baby. Even though most people know that there is little chance that the baby will arrive on a set date and that you often go over time, it is still your BF that has been the concrete thing. It is not so strange, it is in human nature to like to have a time frame to relate to, but small babies have little interest in the concept of time. The baby is not overweight yet, but it is still heavy. Both physically and mentally. The physical burden is not to play with, and having to answer the questions of those around you if the baby has arrived can still feel incredibly frustrating. Especially when there is no urge to do it yourself to make the child want to come out. On the other hand, you can sometimes get help with a membrane wrap to help the body start the pains. This is something that is done through a vaginal examination which means that the midwife stimulates the uterine tube.

            When a pregnancy has lasted for more than 42 weeks, it is usually called overbearing and the birth will start. But that it goes over 42 weeks is unusual, only 5% of all children are overweight, and why no one actually knows. Maybe it's simply that the baby has it way too cozy in there in the womb. Even if you do not know what it is due to, you have seen that there are certain factors that come into play. The probability is higher for a first-time mother to go over time, and then also that the pregnancy becomes unbearable. But there may also be heredity involved, if you have a biological mother or sister who has had to wait longer, or even carried over time, the risk is a little greater that you will do it yourself. After the estimated date of birth, you go for increasingly close checks to see that the baby in the womb continues to feel good. The person carrying the child can be involved and decide when, or if, initiation should take place - most people choose to plan an initiation after an ultrasound done v.41 +0, but you can wait longer to be initiated if you want .

            Fight on - it's ready soon! For now, it is not fun for most people to be pregnant anymore. Now it's just ultra heavy and very easy to feel abandoned and to lose your temper. Even if you may have doubts, we can promise that your little baby will come out, in one way or another. Do you feel that you are completely finished with the answer "no, no child yet!" on the surroundings' questions, it is totally accepted with a mass text message that says that you will hear from you when the child lands! We have written it before, but a little reminder that you should always call the delivery if the water goes, you get bleeding, reduced fetal movements, regular pains, reduced pains or feel anxious or scared. But you already know that.

            Over 90 percent of all pregnant women have given birth before the end of this week. The probability that it happens by itself is therefore very large, and actually increases with each passing day. If you belong to the few percent that go over week 42, the pregnancy is called overbearing and you will then have time to start the birth. There is a reason not to let the pregnancy last longer than week 42, and that is because the placenta will gradually start to deteriorate after this week. There are a few different ways to start childbirth, the most common is to get hormone tablets that you dissolve in water and swallow that start it all. Then it can also be the case that there are reasons why you may need to have a caesarean section - it depends a bit on how the mother and child feel. We know that it can feel a little frustrating that the birth may not have turned out as planned, that the notion of how it would be may be scrapped. Even if the birth is in some way what you have been waiting for, it is really only the beginning of the rest of your life as a parent. And how your little child comes out is not the important thing, but that you will soon meet the one who makes the heart overflow with happiness.
