            The child has become around 8 cm long and is in an intense growth phase. It gets stronger and the movements more and more purposeful - even if they are not voluntary yet: the child manages to hold his head up for a while, the hand can grip a little clumsily and the foot can kick. The proportions are slowly getting better, the legs are longer than the arms, the body is growing, the eyes and ears are starting to move to their places and the bridge of the nose is making its entrance. The amniotic fluid is newly formed all the time until full time. Now it's also time for the important myelin production to get started. Myelin acts as insulation around the nerves, which send communication through the brain. This production continues during the first years of the child's life.

            Your uterus now reaches a bit above the pubic bone and the body continues to change at an ever faster pace. Your stomach gets bigger and bigger, you become more easily out of breath and your heart rate beats a little faster than it usually does. Maybe it sounds hard? But many people still experience that they are starting to feel really good - perhaps because the stomach has not had time to get heavy and that there has been a calm in the body over expecting a child. You may have noticed a slight hint of a dark stripe on your stomach? Many people get a straight line between the upper abdomen and down to the pubic bone called Linea nigra. It comes because you have more pigment now that you are pregnant, which is due to the hormones. The stripe on the stomach will probably fade away when the baby arrives. Any extra pigment that the hormones offer can also cause pigment spots in other places, for example on the face. It is called chloasma and can be avoided by using a high sun protection factor and making sure to shade your face and head when you are in the sun. You should always be careful with the sun, and you can simply think that it is a little extra now when you are expecting a child.

            It is often difficult to understand a pregnancy when you live in the middle of it, usually not so much for the person carrying the baby - but for you as a partner, it is not surprising if it becomes abstract. Maybe you already have a little working name for the crab in your stomach, if not then it can be easier to imagine the child if you give it a little nickname. It often becomes easier to think of it as a small individual, and you can fantasize about what the personality is like, or what it will look like. Writing down your thoughts and feelings - or just what happened during the day - can make it easier to go back later and reflect on how it felt then. Seeing it written down can also make it clear how you have connected to the little life that is waiting to meet you.

            If your child has a predisposition for dark hair, it is now that that pigment begins to be produced. However, it is not certain that the hair itself is in place yet - for many children it will not come until months after birth. The eyebrows, on the other hand, appear this week. On the entire small body, the thin skin is covered by the colorless lanugo hair, or wool hair. It is probably there to help maintain body heat and as you approach childbirth it disappears more and more. Through the fragile skin you can see small, thin blood vessels. The cerebellum and spinal cord are predisposed. The baby begins to store calcium to be used for the development of the skeleton and its bone marrow. Even though there is no air, the child still makes breathing movements with the chest, as if to practice. Now it can also get the thumb in the mouth.

            Your mother's heart has not only swelled emotionally to hold the little baby in its womb but also increased its physical capacity. The explanation is the increasing blood volume which can make some women short of breath and give them palpitations. It can feel a little scary the first few times you feel it, but is completely harmless. The uterus is getting bigger, but in the beginning of the pregnancy it grows primarily upwards, which means that the downward pressure is usually light. So you may now be able to celebrate that the most acute phase of constant urination needs to have probably subsided. Maybe you vaguely remember the waist you had? It together with the tight favorite jeans is just a memory. At least for the next year. If this is not the first time you are expecting a child, you are probably a little bigger if your stomach is now the last time. This is because your skin and stomach have already gone through everything before, which makes it stretch and spread more easily this turn.

            Soon your child will be able to perceive sounds. This means that you can sing and talk to it through your stomach and that the baby will recognize your voice once it is born. It may feel a little strange at first, to sit and sing for a tummyâ€¦ but for the baby it is a great security to hear a familiar voice once it has come into the world. If there are siblings, you can encourage them to talk to their future siblings. Research has shown that infants prefer bright voices - have you considered that you yourself may unknowingly use a brighter voice when talking to young children? By the way, did you know that humans are not the only mammals that apply this technology? Dolphin mothers sing for their young when it is in the womb so that it will recognize the mother's special sound when it is born. Dolphins have different names for each other and it is believed that it is her name she sings for the kid repeatedly.

            The child has sprinted in length and is now about 14-15 cm long and weighs about 100 grams. Muscles and bones are formed, as are the nails that you can now see. Now you can also guess the facial features. The baby can suck on the thumb and swallow, sometimes when they inhale and drink the amniotic fluid, they may have hiccups - so far it may not be noticeable but later it can be felt in the whole stomach. The amniotic fluid is constantly metabolized by the baby breathing, swallowing and then urinating. It may feel a little strange that someone urinates inside your stomach, but it is pure amniotic fluid that comes out and it is an important part of the process. The amount of amniotic fluid also increases every day, giving the baby more and more freedom of movement. The nervous system now works, the child can wrinkle his forehead and the neat head measures approximately 30 mm in diameter. The small, and still very immature child, moves all the time and the movements become more and more coordinated.

            The ligaments that hold the uterus in place sometimes tighten, which can be experienced as a stabbing or stabbing pain in the sides. It usually occurs during violent movements, such as if you sneeze or laugh. Your stomach grows and the uterine wall stretches more and more. Right now, the body is pumping around 20 percent more blood than usual, which together with the pregnancy hormones can make your mucous membranes swell. This means that you can have more discharge than you are used to and that it is easier for you to get a stuffy nose. Swollen mucous membranes can also make it easier to start bleeding. Which you may notice when you brush your teeth and the gums start to bleed or that a careless sniffing can cause some nosebleeds. Do not give up toothbrushing but change to a softer brush. If you have a nasal congestion from the swollen mucous membranes, you can try sleeping a little extra high with your head, or use nasal drops or spray with saline solution. If it does not work, and the nasal congestion becomes far too difficult, you can consult with your midwife.

            Soon you will experience an often skyrocketing feeling of seeing the little life in the womb. The routine ultrasound that is usually done around week 18 is for many people a concrete confirmation that you are really expecting a child. Many regions let you choose if you want to find out if it is a girl or boy lying there in the womb. Some feel that it can be easier to connect if they know the gender of the child, while others absolutely do not want to know and would rather it be a surprise. Maybe you think it's nice to be able to be completely neutral when it comes to gender and your unborn child, or you have a great need to think about names and want to fantasize about a future with a little boy half or a girl on your arm. Regardless of your and your partner's attitude to it all, you can probably count on receiving the question from the environment - if you do not want to tell us, a simple answer is that it is a child you are expecting.

            It goes fast now, the child measures about 18 cm between the head and the small butt, the weight is somewhere around 200 grams. It lacks almost completely subcutaneous fat - but will from now on start storing fat in the body. A certain type of fat, called brown fat, acts a bit like a survival reserve for the baby and helps it retain heat once the baby is out. Arms and legs are thin - most of the skeleton still consists of soft and flexible cartilage. During the second trimester, brain development is intense. It is protected by loosely assembled skull bones that eventually close, but the fontanelles, the large soft surfaces between the skull bones, remain for a long time - often until the children are around two years old. Eyelids cover the eyes, which will not open until week 26, but the baby still experiences its surroundings and can react to what happens on the outside of the stomach by, for example, jerking at suddenly loud noises. It can still move quite freely inside the membrane sac. The baby now weighs more than the placenta and in all probability the pregnancy will start to show.

            Being pregnant does not always have to mean bags under the eyes, bad skin or ailments - on the contrary, the second trimester can offer a boost for both hair, skin and mood. That glow that people talk about can very well come and many also sleep well, a kind of peace can settle in the soul. It is also not impossible that sexual desire increases due to the increased amount of blood because it also affects the pelvic area and the mucous membranes of the uterus. For those of you who do not understand at all what we are talking about, the beautiful hair, the smooth skin and the fantastic sex drive is not something that everyone gets. There is no evenly distributed justice when it comes to the benefits of pregnancy.

            Are you thinking of a trip before the baby arrives? If the pregnancy is without too many ailments and is going well, it may be a good idea to take care of it soon. It is fine to travel both on the ground and by air, but the airlines may have different rules for how late in pregnancy you can travel with them. It may also be wise to check with the insurance company what applies if care is needed abroad - most home insurances, for example, do not cover health care costs after week 28. In addition to checking with the insurance company, a check with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swedish Public Health Agency is always to be done. You and your partner may need to think an extra lap on the pack, if you are flying, support stockings and nasal drops with saline solution can be practical. And if you travel to the sun, it is certainly always wise to include a sun protection factor, but since pregnant women are more likely to get pigment spots, it is extra good to be careful with it now.

            The baby in the womb grows so it cracks - now it weighs 250 grams and is about 20 cm long. The ears have landed where they should sit for the rest of their lives and now protrude a little from the head, the eyes have come closer to the front of the face and are adorned with eyebrows and hints of lashes. During the closed eyelids, the retina has become clear and can now react to light. The child has just started to register sound. The small face can make faces and grease accumulates on the fingertips which makes it possible to guess the small lines that will become the fingerprints.

            Are you waiting for the first kick? It is very individual when you feel it. If you have been expecting a child before, you know what feeling to look for, but if it is the first time, it can take several weeks before you feel that it really was a kick. Sometimes it can feel like butterfly wings fluttering, sometimes you wonder if it is even the intestines that are bubbling a little extra. It is also not entirely uncommon for the placenta to be located in the anterior wall of the uterus, which makes it a little harder to feel the movements in the beginning and that it takes longer before you feel small kicks or movements. Around week 18, you will be offered a routine ultrasound. It is a voluntary, painless and flexible method where you get to see an ultrasound image of the fetus. The picture shows, among other things, how it develops and if there may be more than one child in it, then you can also find out where the placenta is. When the ultrasound is done, the midwife will also be able to check the estimated date of birth.

            You can probably still not feel the first kicks, even if it is highly individual, it is usually expected that for a first-time mother it will take at least week 20 - maybe even longer. But it is something to long for, because it becomes such a concrete and clear sign that you are going to become a parent. Many say that they attached even stronger to the child after the first kick. The routine ultrasound will probably take place soon. It is voluntary to do, but for many it can be nice to know that the child is developing as it should. On the ultrasound, you can also see how much amniotic fluid there is, where the placenta is located and if the estimated date of birth is correct. It is also now that you can see if there is one or more children in the womb - if there are several, it can usually be an extra dizzying time before the many, and sometimes conflicting, feelings land. If you are expecting more than one child, you as a parent may need a little more time and support to prepare, a tip is to talk to other twin or triplet parents. In addition to all the thoughts of you as parents, it will also mean more checks at the midwife to see that the children grow as they should.

            The life of the baby in the womb is quiet but far from silent, because between weeks 18 and 20 the baby's hearing develops. It becomes aware of sound in its surroundings; blood flowing through vessels and umbilical cords, heartbeats and intestinal bubbles - but also some loud sounds that penetrate through the uterine wall. The nerve cells of the brain that have to do with the different senses; hearing, smell, taste, touch and sight become more specialized and create complex connections. Around this week, a thick layer of fat will begin to cover the baby's skin as protection against amniotic fluid. It is called fetal fat and is a bit like dough. Most of it disappears before birth, just like the lanugo hair it is stuck in. Now you can also clearly see the dental system - both for the baby teeth and for the teeth the baby will get later.

            But all security, you have noticed, or will soon notice, all the surroundings' questions about the child and the pregnancy. Some people love to talk about their pregnancy, to plan and really get to snuggle into the pregnancy bubble. Others are unable to focus on anything at all due to nausea, fatigue and hormones ravaging around. Then there are those who feel a little deprived of their own selves - you are the same person as before, with more interests and commitments than expecting children. All ways of feeling and being are equally right, no one can decide how to relate to their pregnancy. Feel how YOU want it. Guide conversations, well-meaning advice and thoughtful questions wherever you want and find reassurance that you know best what your pregnancy is like and who you are in it. If you have a partner, all questions to you can make him or her feel excluded. Your partner should also be a parent and even if it is you who carries the child, you are at least two about this. If you do not like the reactions of those around you, talk through and make a pact where you can let your partner take more place in the discussions, both with friends, family and in care. For example, you do not have to be the most read - but lean on the fact that your common knowledge is enough!

            To want, and to be allowed to be, included in the pregnancy is important! You as a partner often have just as strong feelings about the child as your partner, only that you do not carry it (you will have to do that in about 21 weeks). But often the eyes and surroundings of the surroundings may be directed towards the person who is pregnant, especially later in the pregnancy when the bodily changes are more and more visible. She may even be plagued with a lot of physical discomfort and everyone wants to show compassion and consideration. But even though you may avoid joint loosening, you should also become a parent and your thoughts and experiences are important. A tip on a good way to feel - and become - more included is to actively try to be part of the conversations; read on, take it upon yourself to become a parent and ask questions to others who are also expecting children or are already parents. In care, you are mostly good at making sure both pregnant and partner, but if you feel excluded, the same applies there: make sure to ask questions and show that there are more expectant parents in the room.

            Your little baby is now about 24 cm long and weighs around 350 grams. The head has a diameter of just over 4 cm and the brain inside undergoes an intensive developmental period. Millions of nerve cells will be needed for motor skills. The development of the nerve pathways means that the child now tests his reflexes, grabs and sucks on the thumb as you can see in the picture. It also swallows amniotic fluid, a congenital reflex that is important after birth when the baby is about to start eating. There is still quite a lot of space for the baby to move, it dives and rolls around in the half liter of amniotic fluid that is around. There is a fairly large turnover on the water, half of it is actually swallowed by the child every day and just as much is urinated out. The little heart beats between 110 and 160 beats per minute, just as it should. Until now, your baby has grown about as much each week as any other baby in the womb around the world, but from now on there will be greater individual differences in how much they grow.

            Cheers, now you've fixed half the pregnancy! But maybe you do not have a superork to celebrate? It is not uncommon for you to start feeling tired, which halfway through pregnancy can often be due to iron deficiency. This is zero percent strange because your body is currently working up to 40-50 percent more blood than usual. It is the body's fascinating and clever way of adapting and controlling so that the pregnancy gets the best of conditions, all the extra blood is needed for the baby to get the oxygen and nutrition it needs. But not only that, the blood is also there for you to have some reserves so that you can bleed when you give birth. Because that is how it is, it will consume some blood even if it is not something that most people think of right then. If you think it feels a little uncomfortable, you can talk to the midwife. At MCC, the iron levels will be checked regularly, but if you feel dizzy or tired and it takes a while before you go there again, you should definitely call and talk to the midwife. You should not have to accept a tiredness without knowing what your iron values â€‹â€‹look like! It is possible to get extra iron by eating foods with good iron content, but most people need some form of iron supplementation during pregnancy.

            Now you are halfway there! You may not have felt the first kick yet, but it will come soon. Just like this, when the child's movements begin to be felt, it is a little difficult to know if it really is a kick, it can next be experienced more as a tickle or as a butterfly fluttering inside the stomach. For those of you who do not carry the baby, it will probably take a while before you can feel the magical movements. You must not be surprised if the child stops kicking just when you arrive to put your hand on your stomach - the child is already doing exactly what he wants. When your partner walks around, the foaming movements are often sleepy for the baby, which usually makes the baby sleep - and then live the roll in the evenings and nights when it is bedtime. So a tip is to put your hand on your stomach when you both take it easy in the evening, just what it is, a kick appears and your heart probably takes a small shot. The further into the pregnancy you get, the more powerful it feels, towards the end you can even make out a small hand or foot under the skin.

            Time to talk poop, a topic you will most likely be unexpectedly comfortable with in the next few years. Now the baby's intestines have developed so that the nutrients can be absorbed from the amniotic fluid that the baby swallows. The vast majority of the nutrients still come from the mother via the placenta, but some of it passes down through the intestinal system and lands softly in the large intestine. This is where we find it: the baby's first poop, or meconium, as it is also called. It will be replenished during the rest of the pregnancy and come out as a small gift to the person who takes the first diaper changes (unless the baby has time before and poops in the amniotic fluid or just when it comes out). Not only is poop new, now the baby's bone marrow has also begun to help the liver and spleen produce blood cells. From the mother's blood come antibodies, whose job is to help the baby against diseases when it comes out. About now you can also hear the baby's heartbeat with the help of a stethoscope. It can be tricky to know if it's the mother's or the baby's heart you hear, but for each beat the mother's heart beats, the child has time to beat two - so listen for the little quick prick.

            How do you think before the birth? As with everything else, how you feel is very individual. It can be the longing, both to meet the child but also to not have to be two about the body anymore. At the same time, it is not uncommon for childbirth to cause some concern, perhaps even fear. If you are expecting a baby with someone, you may start to worry about something happening to your partner. As strange as it may sound to someone else, it can feel crippling to see your partner climb a ladder! Feeling this way before the birth, even your partner and before becoming a parent is completely natural. The anxiety can perhaps be explained purely biologically, once the baby arrives you are vital to the little parvel and therefore the anxiety is brought to life so that you do not expose yourself to danger. Getting used to not being able to have full control is a big part of becoming a parent. Having a child is a big, life-changing event, probably the absolute greatest experience you get in life and no one is unaffected by it. It can be good to put your feelings into words by talking to someone, being able to verbalize emotions and sort out thoughts can make it easier to avoid unnecessary worry. How much you feel is also individual, some look forward to the birth with curiosity - others panic at the thought of it. If you lean towards the latter, it can help to handle it practically by visiting the hospital (under normal circumstances it is not strange to take a look before it is sharp, during Covid-19 you have to be more humble before it can be difficult ), read about pain relief and childbirth phases. If the anxiety becomes too great and affects your everyday life in a way that limits you, there is nothing you should try to solve yourself. There is help available and your midwife is the first step. There you can get information about therapy to break bad thought patterns or help to get in touch with a psychologist who is often connected to the midwife clinic. In some places in the country, there are also so-called aurora clinics where they specialize in fear of childbirth.

            Being worried about childbirth is completely natural, even for someone whose job it is not to give birth but to stand by, hold hands and pep. Undoubtedly, there will be thoughts on how to be able to be there for your partner in the best way, but also what it will be like to see someone you like so much in pain. There may also be a concern that the child will not feel well. To some extent, you need to accept the feeling of not being able to have full control, even though it can be terribly difficult. But there are things you can do about it. Being well-read and well-informed about everything from childbirth phases, pain relief, to how to find the right one in the hospital, is good and something you can already tackle. Anxiety usually disappears the more you know and can. There are also prophylaxis courses and information meetings at BB - although in pandemic times they can take place in a different way than usual - to attend. Group discussions with other parents-to-be can also help, talking to others in the same situation often provides answers to questions. For many, it can be nice to hear that you are not alone in being afraid of fainting during childbirth, and extra nice to also be told that it is very unusual for this to happen! But sometimes it is not enough with info and acceptance of concern, it can be too much anyway. Then you should know that you as a partner can also contact the midwife to get tools to deal with the anxiety, or help to get a call from an aurora clinic that works with childbirth anxiety. We in Sweden have fantastic maternity care and are one of the countries in the world with the lowest maternal and child mortality, try to find security in it. And to keep in mind that the vast majority of children are born completely healthy!

            All the senses mature and develop more and more with each passing day. Although the baby closes his eyes all the time, he can still see light and darkness through his thin eyelids. The ears have taken shape but are still very soft. They can hear anyway, the baby will remember voices and special pieces of music if they are played many times during pregnancy. The hands feel over the face and body, and the taste buds on the tongue develop. It is also now that the hair on the head begins to grow. It is different how much hair a baby has when it is ready, some are born with a real kalufs - while others have a little bump that is only visible in backlight. The skin is still thin and looks reddish due to all the blood vessels that are superficial and that the subcutaneous fat is not yet really in place. It will settle down in the coming weeks.

            You may have felt your stomach harden for a while and then soften again? These are contractions that may begin to appear now, but are usually more common towards the end of pregnancy, from the third trimester. You can think of the contractions as the uterus' way of training before the birth. Although it may feel a little scary the first few times, there is no danger to the child. It is more common for them to come when you have been a little extra active, such as trained or had sex. Is it the case that it goes a little too wildly, not only during sex but in life in general, then you should see it as the body's way of saying. If you get contractions in the evening when you take it easy after the day, then you should think about trying to take it a little calmer in life. But if they come often or when you are resting - even though you are not stressed - you should talk to the midwife to rule out that it is a urinary tract infection. Of course, you always want to avoid this, but it is extra important to keep track of when you are pregnant. If this is not the first child you are expecting, you can prepare for the fact that there is a good chance that you will feel the contractions both earlier and stronger than the first time.

            Contractions are something that your partner can get from now on, but which becomes more common towards the end of pregnancy. They are the uterus' way of exercising before the birth and often come when you have been a little extra active. If life is generally a little extra stressful, they can also be the body's way of pointing out that it wants to take it a little calmer. It is good if you as a partner know about this, and that you can talk about how you can relieve. From now on, the fetus is considered a child legally because it is medically considered viable. It is extremely unusual to give birth so early in pregnancy, but the legal provision means that the child has the right to medical care and thus that one tries to save the child if it were to be born now.

            550 grams and around 28 cm long - the child continues to grow at a furious pace. The head has now been given a diameter of 5-6 cm and the small femur, which will be the body's largest bone, measures 4 cm. The skin is starting to get its pigment now but this week's giant shot, when it comes to development, takes place in the lungs! There, calm blisters are formed that are filled with amniotic fluid that change until birth. Right at the moment of birth, the amniotic fluid is squeezed out because the baby's chest is squeezed in the birth canal - the next breath the baby takes will fill the lungs with air!

            Now you may be starting to feel that you can do this by being pregnant, life is slowing down and your stomach is growing. It can feel distant to start planning parental leave. But the fact is that the more you think now, the less you need to do (and think!) When the baby has arrived and the brain has become a little foggy from comforting, feeding and sleeping baby. We can promise you that administration and planning is the last thing you want to control then. No later than two months before you want to be free, you need to tell your employer, and it is smart to read at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency about how parental leave works and hear what they need to be able to help you. If you are more expectant parents, now is the time to talk about how parental leave should be divided. It can be a process that is not always frictionless. Research has shown that the relationship feels good when you are helped with parental leave, then there is also something in what everyone says "the first time with the child is something that never comes again". How you then plan and make it go together practically is entirely up to you, you know what will be best for your child and your relationship!

            Forward with the almanac, because now it's smart to plan parental leave. The earlier you talk about how you want to split it up and post it, the better. Then you get one thing less to think about when the little knot has arrived - to just get out the door then can feel like a round-the-world trip. How you choose to divide the leave between you is entirely up to you. Research shows that a relationship feels good when you are helped with parental leave, and no matter how worn it may sound, the first time with your child is something that will never come again. Then everyone has different situations and conditions. Find out how parental leave works, FÃ¶rsÃ¤kringskassan is your best friend in explaining, and do not assume that the joint economy will be worse if the one who earns the most is at home the most. In many families it can even pay to do the opposite due to tax effects and the parental pay that many employers now top the state parental benefit with. So start now to find out what applies and plan. It can be good to know that parental leave is something you are entitled to and that your employer cannot deny it. However, you need to tell your employer at least two months before you go on parental leave.

            Now, more than halfway through the pregnancy, you can see that the baby is starting to look more and more like a newborn baby. It is around 31 cm long, weighs about 650 grams and has a great need to move (there is still plenty of room to splash around). Everything the baby needs from heat, food and stimulation is there in the womb. It responds to more and more sensory impressions - feels, experiences tastes, hears and reacts to sounds. Voices heard in its vicinity can be recognized by the baby and reacted to at birth. The eyes are mostly closed, but the small eyelids may blink. The alveoli that came into place in the lungs last week, and which we call alveoli, now produce a substance called surfactant - they will do so for about ten weeks. Surfactant's job is to keep the alveoli stretched so that the lungs do not collapse and stick together when the child is to fill them with air for the first time. Should the baby come already now, as one of the very few children born so early, there is a chance that it would survive - even if it would need extensive care in the neonatal ward.

            Let's talk a little tits, you may have noticed that they feel a little different lately and that you see the blood vessels more clearly? This is because the mammary glands have begun to mature. It is not uncommon, but it happens far from everyone, that some milk can leak from the breasts already now. It is colostrum, or colostrum as it is also called. The yellow, slightly sticky milk is formed during pregnancy and is incredibly nutritious for the baby to get as much nutrition as possible during the first meals. A couple of days after the baby arrives, it will turn into regular breast milk. If it feels awkward that the breasts are leaking, there are inserts you can buy at the pharmacy and put in a bra, so you do not have to feel like you are walking around with two wet spots. Sometimes it can leak a little more at night, because the breasts can be compressed by how you lie - put a towel under so it does not become uncomfortable. Even if you think it's a bit hard and prefer it to stop, you should not try to squeeze out the milk, because then milk production is triggered and it just gets more. If you do not notice any major difference in your breasts, or if you think that they are so small that it is impossible to satisfy a child, you should know that the size is completely irrelevant here. The amount of milk is not affected by having large or small breasts, or whether it leaks out during pregnancy or not.

            Are there prospective siblings at home? In that case, the risk of jealousy is imminent, especially if it is the first time he is going to have a sibling. The idea of â€‹â€‹having to share your parents with someone else - someone who also cannot be seen, touched or played with - is not a completely uplifting thought. Children do not know that a heart only grows when it finds love and can actually hold as much as it wants! Do not assume that the child is as pep as you on the new little family member. Without listening, confirming and talking with love and empathy about all feelings - and tell them that you can not return a little sibling to BB, even if the suggestions are creative and honest on the part of the child. Jealousy is a natural part, but it can make the journey ahead easier to prepare and involve the older child already during pregnancy: sing the favorite songs for the stomach and tell that the child inside will recognize his big sibling's voice when it comes. Draw drawings, pat your stomach and feel for kicks. If possible, big brother or big sister can come with the midwife to listen to the heart sounds. If you are really daring, you can let the child choose the nameâ€¦ Once the baby has arrived, it can be good to ask relatives and friends who come and visit to say hello and talk to the big sibling first - and feel free to bring a small gift to the big baby to celebrate. A tip is to have some wrapped small gifts ready to present if forgotten.

            Maybe you have noticed that the child has different occasions when it is asleep and awake, it is actually now that some kind of circadian rhythm for the child begins to appear. Awake periods are noticed through the movements, which you now feel every day and which for most people appear in the evenings and nights when the mother is resting. You often learn to recognize the movement pattern. However, how much a child moves is different, some are very active while others take it a little calmer. The hands are actually fully functional from now on, fingers have got nails and the skeleton continues to harden. Now the child measures 33-34 cm and weighs around 750 grams. If the child were born already now, the chances are good that it would survive, a thought that is quite fantastic and perhaps also reassuring.

            Do you need to run and pee on the precipice in the block? Unlike the need to urinate in the beginning of pregnancy, it is now not due to hormones but to the fact that the stomach grows and that the uterus presses on the bladder. This, together with the fact that you collect more fluid during the day, which at night then finds its way to the bladder, means that there can be many trips to the toilet. For some, the need to urinate can be so persistent that it feels hard to leave home for fear of not finding a toilet. Even though it feels tiring to often have to rush and pee, you should definitely not stop drinking for it, the body needs a lot of water and fluid now during pregnancy. Something that actually helps is to do the squeezing exercises often. If you have not started yet, do so now, and continue even after the baby has arrived. Pay attention to whether you get unprovoked contractions, stomach pain or that it hurts when you urinate. It can be a sign of a urinary tract infection, something you can get more easily as a pregnant woman. Contact the midwife in this case - it is important that treatment is started early in the event of a urinary tract infection. About now your midwife will start measuring your tummy. With a measuring tape, the length between the pubic bone (symphysis) and the uterus' upper edge (fundus) is measured and the measure, called the SF measure, is entered on a curve. How the measure is right now does not matter much, but the important thing is that the measurements that come forward follow your curve, without making any dramatic deviations upwards or downwards. There is no reason to think about what is normal, because as with all curves, the most important thing is not to be in the middle of the "normal curve" but to follow your own. The same applies to the baby when it is born and you go for check-ups at the child care center (CCC).

            From now on you will see more of the midwife. There will be more visits the closer you get to the estimated day of birth (bf), and on those visits you will, among other things, measure how your stomach grows. This is done by taking the SF measure - the symphysis fundus measure for those who want to wring their tongue - which is measured over the abdomen with a classic old measuring tape. The midwife also listens to the baby's heart sound - either with a wooden funnel or with an ultrasound monitor. Blood samples are taken, weight and blood pressure are checked and all this data is entered in the mother's medical record and thus becomes available to those who will take care of you during the birth. After the routine ultrasound, you will receive a maternity certificate from the midwife, which confirms the pregnancy and the estimated date of birth according to the ultrasound. If you have not sent it to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency yet, it is time to do it now. Fatherhood or parenthood is waited for until the baby has arrived. If you are married, you are automatically counted as a guardian, but if you are not, it is necessary that the parenthood or paternity is confirmed with the municipality. It may feel a little strange to have to confirm parenthood just because you are not married, but until the government's investigation into updating the Parental Code is complete, the rules are so.

            The baby's small eyes open and close. We know that they have been reacting to light and darkness for some time. It has been possible to see how children in week 26 raise their hands to protect their eyes when a strong light is directed at the stomach. The big step right now is happening in the child's brain. There, phase two of the great development is started: the cerebral cortex gets its furrows and twists so that all nerve cells can fit. There is a lot that should be right, because the next time it is switched in the brain is when the child enters puberty - a dizzying thought that there will be a puberty, now that the baby is safely there in the womb. The child knows what is up and down. Thanks to the fact that the balance organs in the inner ear have now developed, it can notice the difference. And there is the opportunity to test for the child who moves a lot with somersaults and small turns. You do not have to be afraid that it will twist into the umbilical cord, its corkscrew-like appearance makes it quite flexible. It consists of a thick, jelly-like substance that effectively protects the three blood vessels that transport blood between the baby and the placenta.

            Did you know that you have the right to make extra demands on your employer during pregnancy? The labor law says that your work environment must be safe for both you and your child. Thus, an adaptation of your work may be required: heavy or strenuous work steps you should not have to do, nor come into contact with hazardous substances such as solvents or infections. If your employer cannot guarantee a safe working environment, you can apply for pregnancy benefit - what used to be called maternity benefit. Check with the Social Insurance Agency about what applies to you. If you are one of those who suffer from lots of physical problems, it can also mean that you need to be on sick leave. Suffering from "normal" pregnancy problems is usually not counted as an illness, but if you are struggling with a broken back, have a nausea that never goes away or just need to take it easy for the baby to feel good, a doctor can write a medical certificate. If you feel that you do not want, or have the strength, to work until the child arrives, you have the right to take your parental days from and including 60 days before the expected birth. According to the law, you must flag for your employer two months before you intend to be off, but if you notice that you need to be off earlier than you first planned, you can talk to your boss and explain how you feel. Maybe it is possible to find a solution together. Your sickness benefit qualifying income, SGI, should not normally be affected if you stop working or lose time during the last six months of pregnancy. Of course, it depends a bit on how your work situation has been, so check with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency for safety reasons.

            The stomach is now getting bigger and bigger. You may have noticed that your partner has become a little clumsy? This is because the center of gravity in the body completely changes, which can actually be a little difficult to get used to. The growing belly can also cause problems with low back and pelvic pain - the longer your partner is, the harder it usually gets. But a pregnancy can serve different types of back problems, such as sciatica and joint loosening, so before you run to the nearest chiropractor, you should talk to the midwife who can help you figure out what type of treatment is needed. It can be physiotherapist and exercises, acupuncture or a relieving belt. Some things are always good to keep in mind: even if your partner thinks that his back feels okay right now, it is good if you leave it at that and save a little on it. A pregnant back is a little more fragile than usual, so make sure you take the heavy lifts as much as possible. Then it is also important to move every day, it hurts, you can recommend taking short steps and not going that far, have an upright posture, avoid the stairs and have good shoes - an excellent gift tip if you feel daring. And then there is the rest! Resting is super important and will be all the way to the goal, it consumes energy when creating a baby.

The whole little knot weighs almost 1 kilo. The skin is still red, thin and covered with fetal fat, but the face has become a little rounder.

All movements, large and small, that the baby makes train the muscles so that it becomes stronger in the body. Should the baby be born now, it has more than a 90% chance of surviving, it has most of what is needed for a life outside the womb. The lungs can breathe air - although in all probability it would need help in the beginning - and the intestines can receive milk. However, it is almost completely without subcutaneous fat, so it would need a lot of help in maintaining its body temperature. The longer the baby stays in the womb the better, the last third of the pregnancy that you will soon enter, is precisely about the baby to collect subcutaneous fat and mature clearly.

            Have your feet turned into a couple of large lumps at the bottom of your legs? This is because your body has started a new hobby: collecting fluids! It can often feel quite okay in the morning, but then get worse in the evenings, especially if it has been a strenuous day. Resting with your feet in a high position and investing in a good pair of shoes often works wonders. Sure, in your Instagram feed you can see pregnant sticks around in high heels, but they are a rare species. It is also not particularly desirable because tight shoes can make the feet even more swollen. Maybe you do not rejoice over the idea of â€‹â€‹a pair of "foot-straight" shoes, but if you ever have to let function come before form, it is probably now. It is not difficult, most sports or running shops often have good walking shoes and there are also soles or insoles for more shock absorption. If you invest in a pair of functional shoes but think they lack the right look, you can always try to change the shoelaces and vips, you have conjured them into a pair of regular sneakers. If your stomach prevents you from even being close to tying a pair of shoes, the sandals are your best friend, work most of the year with a sock in. Also make sure to take advantage of the pregnancy privilege of throwing your feet on the table so often as possible - even when you are invited.

            Your baby's hearing gets better and better, and the more you sing and talk to it in your stomach, the more it recognizes your voice when it comes out. It will strengthen the closeness between you and give the child extra security. Just flip through the memory of the children's songs you enjoyed as a child and learn them again. You will probably notice later, that children are fond of repetition. A mental exercise for you as a parent can therefore be to sing imse vimse spider "da capo" with unfailing enthusiasm - on both in and out. Singing is not just coziness, closeness and connection, but children's cognitive ability is actually strengthened through music. It is said that children who are sung to learn languages â€‹â€‹and mathematics better. Memory and motor skills also seem to be positively affected - who knows, maybe your baby will be a fan of dancing on the spot!
